    'blocksRewardsDetail.tip2': `Three roles are maintained in the HPB system: high-performance nodes, candidate nodes and voters. Among them, high-performance nodes and synchronization nodes can rotate with each other. Factors influencing this rotation include the node's number of votes and network bandwidth, as shown below.`,

    'blocksRewardsDetail.tip4': `HPB System Rewards are divided into: Voting Rewards, Mining Rewards and Pledge Rewards, as shown in the figure below. These rewards for nodes come from a fixed inflationary issuance of 3M HPB a year. Pledge Rewards are currently subsidized by HPB Foundation.`,

    'blocksRewardsDetail.tip6':'First calculate that there are 60 * 60 * 24 * 365 seconds in a year.  ',
    'blocksRewardsDetail.tip7':'The annual fixed block rewards of 3 million HPB are divided by the number of seconds in a year, to get the number of rewards per second.',
    'blocksRewardsDetail.tip8':'Calculate the time consumed for 200 blocks, and you can get the number of rewards that can be obtained for these two hundred blocks. In the configuration, a block is generated every 6 seconds. Actually, there will be deviations due to network conditions. The final reward number is subject to the time difference.',
    'blocksRewardsDetail.tip9':'Two-thirds of the Rewards every 200 blocks are distributed to nodes (mining machines), among which high-performance nodes will equally split these Rewards * 0.35, and candidate nodes will equally split these Rewards * 0.65.',
